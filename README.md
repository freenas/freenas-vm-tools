## Welcome to the FreeNAS 10 VM tools repo

In this repo, you will find an application that you can install on a Linux or
BSD OS that will allow you to monitor guest information like IP address and
health from the host to assist you in managing your VMs on your FreeNAS box.

Included in this document are instructions on how to build and install the tools on
various guest operating systems.

## To install on Arch linux:
* You can automate the install by using the PKGBUILD _freenas-vm-tools-git_ from the Arch User Repository or install manually using the following instructions


* First, install development and required libraries:
```
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel git cmake binutils clang libmariadbclient libtool unixodbc
```

* Next, install poco:

``` 
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/poco.git
cd poco
makepkg
sudo pacman -U poco-1.7.7-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz
```

* Then build freenas-vm-tools:
```
git clone https://github.com/freenas/freenas-vm-tools
cd freenas-vm-tools
export CXX=clang++
cmake .
make
sudo make install
sudo cp ../systemd/freenas-vm-tools.service /usr/lib/systemd/system
sudo systemctl enable freenas-vm-tools
sudo systemctl start freenas-vm-tools
```

* Now the VM tools should be running on your Arch linux guest and you can monitor them from FreeNAS.

```
unix::>vm arch guest_info
 Property         Description                            Value                     
load_avg     Load average            0.0,0.0,0.0                                   
interfaces   Network configuration   fe80::5d64:ab74:c18f:2522%enp0s1,10.250.0.208 
```

## To install on the Debian 8.4.0 template:

* Update your system, grab pre-requisites, and create a build directory: 

```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install build-essential openssl libssl-dev libiodbc2 libiodbc2-dev clang cmake git binutils libtool unixodbc
mkdir ~/build
```

* Grab and build POCO:

```
cd ~/build
wget https://pocoproject.org/releases/poco-1.7.8/poco-1.7.8.tar.gz
tar zxvf poco-1.7.8.tar.gz
cd poco-1.7.8
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

* Clone and build freenas-vm-tools:

```
cd ~/build
git clone https://github.com/freenas/freenas-vm-tools
cd freenas-vm-tools
export CXX=clang++
cmake .
make
sudo make install
sudo mkdir -p /usr/lib/systemd/system
sudo cp systemd/freenas-vm-tools.service /usr/lib/systemd/system
sudo systemctl enable freenas-vm-tools
sudo systemctl start freenas-vm-tools
```

You should now be able to validate its working via the FreeNAS 10 UI or command line like the Arch instructions above.
